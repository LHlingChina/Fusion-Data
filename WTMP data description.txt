The scenario description of WTMP is as follows. (1) When the WFMS detects a turbine fault, it first initiates automatic repair, which is usually sufficient to resolve minor issues. If automatic repair fails, manual maintenance is initiated immediately; (2) A preliminary analysis of the detected fault is conducted, followed by the formulation of an initial maintenance plan; (3) A maintenance vehicle is dispatched to the faulty turbine, carrying the necessary equipment and tools; (4) The faulty turbine components are inspected to assess the severity of the fault and determine whether disassembly is required; (5) If significant debris accumulation is detected, the debris is removed, and the turbine is tested to verify proper operation; (6) If damaged components require replacement, the types and quantities of required are identified. Spare parts are then requested from the spare parts center. In case of insufficient inventory, additional components are sourced from the manufacturing facility; and (7) Once the necessary parts arrive, the faulty components are replaced, and a final test is conducted to ensure the turbine is operating correctly and the fault has been fully resolved.
